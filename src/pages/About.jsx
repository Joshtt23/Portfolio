      My name is Joshua Traver, I am a 24 year old software developer. Recently
      graduated from Eastern Florida State College with a Associate of Arts and
      Associate of Science with a focus in Computer Science. Since a young age I
      have been attracted to software development, starting off creating command
      line games, basic HTMl/CSS, and modding video games saves.A few years
      later in life my cousin John Traver started teaching himself coding and
      founded companies Katadata and then Frame.io and this resulted in showing
      me more passion for the craft, I then chose to move on to learning more
      advanced languages such as C#, C++, and Java. Realizing quickly I enjoy
      building things with rapid development. I quickly moved to more fast
      paced languages such as Python, React, Node, and Next for the ability to
      cover full frontend and backend production. Lately, it has been my passion to
      merge the world into a new age of web3 incorporating blockchain into my
      skill set. One day hoping that we will be fully integrated with
      decentralization across the World Wide Web.
